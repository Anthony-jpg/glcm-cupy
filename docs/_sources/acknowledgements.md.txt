## URECA & Motivation

The project's need stemmed from a CV research project: Classifying Tree Species
in Singapore from multispectral drone data. Many projects in the same field realized
GLCM processed images yield highly important features.

However, current GLCM implementations in the Python field were subpar for automation,
they mainly lacked speed. Thus, this project was born to tackle this issue.
